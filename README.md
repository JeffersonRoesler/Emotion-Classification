# Emotion-Classification
In this project, we aimed to compare three different word embedding methods—TF-IDF, GloVe, and spaCy embeddings—to determine their effectiveness in classifying emotions from text data. The dataset used for this analysis contains text samples labeled with three emotions: anger, fear, and joy.
